# JPACRUDProject
This app allows a user to search within and manipulate the data of a database consisting of the 32 NFL teams.
###Description
Through this app, a user will be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data of teams within the database, allowing for research to be conducted, and changes to be updated in real time as they occur (i.e a team changes it's name or Head Coach).
The app can be found hosted on an ec2 instance at:

###Technologies Used
* Spring Boot MVC
* JPA
* Gradle
* Java POJO
* Object Mapping

###Lessons Learned
The integration of a various technologies and software programs was the primary challenge of this project. Throughout the project I wiped my database more than once due to being unfamiliar with the MYSQL database create software. This was difficult and time consuming, and taught me the importance of ensuring that I fully understand the effects of actions throughout the software suite I'm working in.
